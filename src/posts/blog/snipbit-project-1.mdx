Alright gang! I am finally jumping on the Gastby bandwagon for a new blog/snippet/bookmark aggregator project. For the longest time I have been using a scattering system of [Notion](https://www.notion.so), [Chrome Snippets](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/snippets/) and [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/discover) to store my coding related notes, snippets and bookmarks. It's gotten to a point where I mostly resort to doing a google search cause it's faster than trying to find my own references.

Time for a new all-in-one system! Introducing the _Snipbit_, a single place where I store all my code-related snipped bits, blog posts, snippets and bookmarks, with optimized searchability and tagging to help me find anything I need as fast as I know how.

This project is all about searchability with an emphasis on tagging. I am starting the first version without a client-side CMS (except for bookmark management) and the editing functionality will not be open to the public. I want to use mdx for most of the contents, and though there are plugins available to process mdx on clientside I am opting to leave it for a future reversion later.
