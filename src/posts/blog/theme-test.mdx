One of the easiest ways to make fonts _responsive_ is to resize the fonts according to the viewport’s size or the browser’s window size. There are various **viewport units**, in relation to the axes of the browser window, provided by CSS that are very useful in making responsive web pages. Some viewport units are `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, and `vmax`. We can get the information of these units from the [CSS units](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp). We can use these viewport units instead of `em`, `px`, or `pt` to make the responsive fonts.

How about some ~~strikethrough~~ text? Here's some inline code `const someStr = 'this is some string'`

I need to highlight these <span class="highlight">very important words</span>. I love me some H<sub>2</sub>O and X<sup>2</sup> right now.

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]
