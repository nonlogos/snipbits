## Objectives

This is written in the CSS Tricks article referenced above. I am reciting here for quick recap on what we are trying to achieve.

- The whole thing should be linked and clickable.
- It should be able to contain more than one link.
- Content should be semantic so assistive tech can understand it.
- The text should be selectable, like regular links.
- Things like right-click and keyboard shortcuts should work with it
- Its elements should be focusable when tabbing.
