## Problem solving approach

### 1. Understand the problem

- Can I restate the problem in my own words to make sure I understand the problem
- What are the inputs, what should the inputs look like?
- What are the outputs, what should the outputs look like?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem. (You may not be able to answer this until you set about solving the problem but that's okay).
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are parts of the problem?

### 2. Explore concrete examples

- starts with simple inputs
- handles empty input and invalid inputs
- test for complex inputs

### 3. Break it down

### 4. Solve/simplify

### 5. Look back and refactor

## Problem solving patterns

- [Frequency Counter](#frequencyCounter)
- [Multiple Pointers](#multiplePointers)
- [Sliding Window](#slidingWindow)
- [Divide and Conquer](#divideNConquer)
- [Dynamic Programming]
- [Greedy algorithms]
- [Backtracking]
- [more]

### <a name="frequencyCounter">Frequency Counter</a>

Uses objects or sets to collect values/Frequencies of values.  
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays / strings.

#### Same

<pre>
	<code className="language-javascript">{same.toString()}</code>
</pre>

### <a name="multiplePointers">Multiple Pointers</a>

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, the middle or the end based on certain conditions. **Time complexity - O(n), Space complexity - O(n)**.

#### Count Unique Values

<pre>
	<code className="language-javascript">{countUniqueValues.toString()}</code>
</pre>

### <a name="slidingWindow">Sliding Window</a>

This pattern involves creating a **window** which can either be an array or number from one position to another.
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).
very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

#### Max Subarray sum

<pre>
	<code className="language-javascript">{maxSubarraySum.toString()}</code>
</pre>

### <a name="divideNConquer">Divide and Conquer</a>

This pattern involves dividing a dataset into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with the subsets of data.
The pattern can tremendously decrease **Time Complexity**
