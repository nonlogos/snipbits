After looking at many user agent solutions online for a good way to detect mobile browsers, I found the MDN's recommendation to be the most reasonable. The key here is not to redesign sites for specific mobile browsers but to optimize certain UIs for better usability on mobile devices.

Not all devices are the same: some mobile devices have big screen sizes, some desktops have a small touchscreen, some people use smart TV's which are an entirely different ballgame altogether, and some people can dynamically change the width and height of their screen by flipping their tablet on its side! Instead of user agent sniffing, we can use Navigator.maxTouchPoints to detect if the user's device has a touchscreen.

```javascript
var hasTouchScreen = false;
if ('maxTouchPoints' in navigator) {
	hasTouchScreen = navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0;
} else if ('msMaxTouchPoints' in navigator) {
	hasTouchScreen = navigator.msMaxTouchPoints > 0;
} else {
	var mQ = window.matchMedia && matchMedia('(pointer:coarse)');
	if (mQ && mQ.media === '(pointer:coarse)') {
		hasTouchScreen = !!mQ.matches;
	} else if ('orientation' in window) {
		hasTouchScreen = true; // deprecated, but good fallback
	} else {
		// Only as a last resort, fall back to user agent sniffing
		var UA = navigator.userAgent;
		hasTouchScreen =
			/\b(BlackBerry|webOS|iPhone|IEMobile)\b/i.test(UA) || /\b(Android|Windows Phone|iPad|iPod)\b/i.test(UA);
	}
}
if (hasTouchScreen) document.getElementById('exampleButton').style.padding = '1em';
```
